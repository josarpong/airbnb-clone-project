# AIRBNB-CLONE-PROJECT

This project is a full-stack clone of the popular accommodation booking platform AirBnB. The goal is to build a functional web application that allows users to browse property listings, view detailed property information, and complete bookings. The project will cover frontend development, backend APIs, database design, and deployment.

3.   **Feedback**: Makes it easier for clients and stakeholders to give specific input.

4.   **Usability**: Helps test user experience (UX) before full development.

5.   **Efficiency**: Saves time and cost by fixing issues early.
